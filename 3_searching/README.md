# Chapter 3 - Searching

__Overview.__ Modern computing and the internet have made accessible a vast amount of information. The ability to efficiently search through this information is fundamental to computation. This chapter describes classical _searching_ algorithms that have proven to be effective in numerous applications for decades. We use the term _symbol table_ to describe an abstract mechanism where we save information (a value) that we can later search for and retrieve by specifying a key.

- [3.1 Elementary Symbol Tables](1_symbol_tables) includes unordered and ordered implementations, using arrays or linked lists.
- [3.2 Binary Search Trees](2_binary_search_trees) describes binary search trees.
- [3.3 Balanced Search Trees](3_balanced_search_trees) describes red-black BSTs, a data structure that guarantees logarithmic performance per symbol table operation.
- [3.4 Hash Tables](4_hash_tables) describes two classic hashing algorithms: separate chaining and linear probing.
