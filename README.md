# Princeton COS 226 Resources
The following 3 resources follow the same structure in different levels of depth. If the concepts are completely new, I would recommend going through the Full Book option as it is the most thorough. If these concepts are familiar, then I would start with the Book Site. The lecture slides are a great place to turn if you get stuck on a section. Note these are written in <b>Java</b>; one does not need to know to code in Java to understand the material, but at least roughly be able to read it. Python version coming soon :)

1. [Full Book](http://www.albertstam.com/Algorithms.pdf) - Most verbose and thorough.
2. [Book Site](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home) - Most concise, but least thorough.
3. [Course Site with Lecture Slides](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr13/cos226/lectures.php) - Provides more visuals for step by step process of algorithms.
