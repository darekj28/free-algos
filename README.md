# Python Version of Algs4 Files

Many if not all of these files were built as reference using Princetons [Algs4](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu). These files are direct Python translations of the Java files provided in that course. Even some of the text used to describe them in markdowns is the same with the intention of being consistent.
