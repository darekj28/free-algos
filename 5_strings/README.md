# Chapter 5 - Strings

__Overview.__ We communicate by exchanging strings of characters. We consider classic algorithms for addressing the underlying computational challenges surrounding applications such as the following:

- [5.1 String Sorts](1_string_sorts) includes LSD radix sort, MSD radix sort, and 3-way radix quicksort for sorting arrays of strings.
- [5.2 Tries](2_tries) describes R-way tries and ternary search tries for implementing symbol tables with string keys.
- [5.3 Substring Search](3_substring_search) describes algorithms for searching for a substring in a large piece of text, including the classic Knuth-Morris-Pratt, Boyer-Moore, and Rabin-Karp algorithms.
<!-- - [5.4 Regular Expressions](4_regular_expressions) introduces a quintessential search tool known as grep that we use to search for incompletely specified substrings. -->
